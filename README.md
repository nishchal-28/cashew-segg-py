# cashew-segg-py
This repository is dedicated towards creating a model that can segregate different types of varieties of "cashews".
This is a classic supervised learning problem in which we have input with their "labels" have been given.

## Data Architecture:
We have beenm given with 22 varieties of Cashews with their image files in 22 folders.  
Each file consists of 10 image files in which there are 4 images of each cashew - FRONT, BOTTOM, RIGHT, LEFT.  
Therefore, there are total of 864 image files.
